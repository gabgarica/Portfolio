          <p> As an aspiring digital media artist, I work with a combination of photography and digital tools to create digital graphics. My art blends traditional and modern media, allowing me to express my personal ideas, feelings, and aesthetics during the digital age we live in. I mainly draw inspiration from the beauty found in everyday contemporary life, along with the power of activist-driven work that seeks to engage and inspire action. Artists like Rafael Rozendaall, Keith Haring, and Marina Abramović influence me for their ability to blend personal aspects with their creative output, creating meaningful visuals. Their work moves me to create pieces that are not only aesthetically appealing or beautiful but also thought-provoking, poignant, and emotionally resonant. 
            <br /><br /> 
            I hope my body of work explores themes of beauty, authenticity, and social issues. One of my intentions is to create art that not only engages the senses but also invites viewers to reflect their own feelings towards contemporary challenges such as political polarization, corporate greed, and mental health.
            As of right now, I’m curating a virtual exhibition based on either the rise of hyperfeminism, LGBTQ+ artists, or global warming. This project will allow me to showcase social and political concerns and themes, offering a commentary on current trends while highlighting themes of intersection of gender, identity, and nature. I’m relatively new to the art world at large; most of my life, I’ve been a viewer and appreciator of art, which is why I’m now challenging myself to create art that resonates both aesthetically and socially. Thank you.
