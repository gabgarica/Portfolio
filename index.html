           <p> I’m a first-generation art student from the East Bay of California with an AA in Graphic Design, currently working towards multiple degrees. I enjoy building meaningful, genuine, and lasting connections, as well as gaining creative inspiration and insights of contemporary life.  </p>

          <h2>Digital Composite</h2>
          <h5>Brat Charli XCX poster, Aug 2024</h5>
          <img src="gabgarcia copy.png"/>

          <!-- <p>Mock-up poster</p> -->
            <br />
            <p> This concert poster collage was inspired by Charli XCX's Brat Tour. I aimed to keep the design on theme with a simple color palette that reflects the tour’s aesthetic. Although it's a mockup, I hope viewers enjoy the traditional concert-poster layout, and fans appreciate it as if it were real. I chose to focus on Charli XCX because of the anticipation and trends surrounding her upcoming tour on social media. I created the collage using Adobe Photoshop and designed the layout and text with Adobe Illustrator. My goal was to design a tour poster that a fan could buy at the merch stands during or after the show. </p>

          <h2>Glitch Art</h2>
          <h5>Pt. 1, Sept 2024</h5>
          <img src="final copy.jpg"/>
          <p> For this glitch art, titled Part 1 (pt.1), I focused on using vibrant images with strong hues of pink and purple. I found that colorful images, especially those with bold hues, allowed for more dynamic and unpredictable results when manipulated through Audacity and a text editor. I also chose this image because it's one of my favorites, and the glitch effect is somewhat reminiscent of the style seen in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. </p>
          <h5>Pt. 2, Sept 2024</h5>
          <img src="web copy.jpg"/>
          <p>For Part 2, I mostly relied on Audacity to produce this particular glitch effect. Once again, I chose a web image with vibrant colors and hues. My goal was to glitch specific parts of the image, making it more abstract and unrecognizable. </p>

          <h2>Twine Narrative</h2>
          <h5><a href="FIXED twine prj copy.html"
            target="_blank"> Read the story here with this link!</a> </h5>
           
          <img src="Twiney.png"/>

          <br />

          <p>This was my first attempt at writing an interactive narrative with different alternative pathways and/or story endings for viewers to engage with. I enjoyed learning how to use Twine, the open-source storyboarding application. Though I kept the CSS style of the game simple, most of my attention was focused on developing an intriguing storyline.</p>
